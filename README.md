# How to get started programming the ATTiny

These are a few example sketches to program the ATTiny85 using your Arduino. The ATTiny is a small, programmable microcontroller that costs < $1. It works great as a low-cost, smaller and less powerful alternative to an Arduino.

We used the Tiny AVR programmer to program the ATTiny, following [these instuctions](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/re-programming-the-lilytiny--lilytwinkle).

If you have a DIP footprint ATTiny (slightly larger with longer legs) instead of the SOIC footprint, you can just plug it in to the socket instead of using the jumper cables and IC Test clip.

# Hardware

- ATTiny85 or [LilyTwinkle](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11364)
- [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801) and USB extension cable
- TM1637 4-digit LED display (we use these for reading voltages, etc. as the ATTiny doesn't easily support serial communication)

If using LilyTwinkle or SOIC footprint ATTiny:
- IC Test Clip - SOIC 8-pin
- Male to Female Jumper wires
